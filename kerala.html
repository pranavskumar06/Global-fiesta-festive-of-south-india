            <h2>Onam</h2>
            <p>Onam is Kerala's vibrant harvest festival celebrated with grandeur to honor the mythical King Mahabali, whose reign is remembered as a golden era of prosperity and equality. Rooted in Hindu mythology, it marks the annual visit of Mahabali from the underworld, symbolizing the values of unity and gratitude. Observed in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August-September), Onam is celebrated with colorful floral carpets (pookkalams), the grand Onam Sadya feast, traditional boat races, and cultural performances like Kathakali and Pulikali. Beyond its historical significance, Onam fosters inclusivity and showcases Keralaâ€™s rich cultural heritage.

            <h2>Vishu</h2>
            <p>Vishu is a traditional festival celebrated in Kerala and parts of Karnataka, marking the Malayalam New Year in April. It symbolizes prosperity and is centered around the Vishukkani, an auspicious arrangement of items like rice, fruits, coins, and a mirror, viewed first thing in the morning. The day is filled with rituals, prayers, and family gatherings, and elders gift money (Vishukkaineetam) to younger members. Vishu signifies hope, renewal, and the start of a prosperous year.
